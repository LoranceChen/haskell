# haskell for fun
taste the pure functional language.  

##why study haskell
I'm interesting haskell for a long time ago, most of metioned it from learning scala.  
* a part of [lift-json](https://github.com/lift/framework/tree/master/core/json#kudos)'s design idea form haskell.  
* ***concurrent programming in scala*** said the language needn't memory model as jvm defined,such as happen-before.  
* There is no `while` and must use recursion even though just a simple method.  
* The most exciting things must be concurrent programming we don't need care about locks because we can't use variable,also,
it will be more difficult if do same thing with language which allow using variable.

this project not has a ensure aim, just do some snippet code for personal and share.
